# fastai-projects
All of my work from the fastai course.

This repository currently only contains my jupyter notebooks. To view them correctly, you may have to install jupyter notebook on your machine. You can get the data that is used for these notebooks from kaggle. I've listed the competition names below.

The easiest way that I have found for downloading kaggle data is with the kaggle-cli command line tool. Please note that before you can download a dataset from kaggle you'll have to sign in, (to kaggle), navigate to the competition webpage, and accept the rules. Definitely check it out!

Also, be sure to checkout the fastai courses for deep learning and machine learning! They're free and very good!
